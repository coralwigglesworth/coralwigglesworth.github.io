        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, and welcome to my professional page! My name is Coral Wigglesworth and I am an aspiring Physician Assistant with a strong commitment to patient care and community service. My journey towards a career in healthcare has been shaped by a variety of experiences that have honed my skills and deepened my passion for helping others. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree, with the goal of attending PA school to further my medical education and training.<br><br>

        My professional experience includes working at the Boys and Girls Club as a Youth Development Professional, where I had the opportunity to mentor and support young individuals in their personal and academic growth. This role allowed me to develop strong communication and leadership skills, as well as a deep understanding of the importance of empathy and patience in fostering positive relationships. Additionally, I served as an Orientation Leader with Student Life at UC Riverside, where I guided new students through their transition to college life, providing them with the resources and support they needed to succeed.<br><br>

        Beyond my professional roles, I am deeply committed to giving back to the community through volunteer work. I regularly volunteer at homeless shelters and soup banks, where I assist in providing essential services to those in need. These experiences have reinforced my dedication to serving others and have given me valuable insights into the diverse challenges faced by different populations. I am excited to continue my journey towards becoming a Physician Assistant, where I can combine my skills, knowledge, and passion to make a meaningful impact in the healthcare field.
